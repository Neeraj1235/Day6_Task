    <!-- The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

    title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
    studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
    rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PGÂ­13, R, etc) -->

    <!-- c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full. -->
